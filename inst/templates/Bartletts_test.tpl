# Introduction

Bartlett's test is used to test the homogeneity of the variances, in other words the equality of the tested variable's variances across the groups. With checking that we want to find if the two groups are coming from the same population.

Homogeneity is useful to being tested, because that is an assumption of the One-Way ANOVA.

# Normality assumption

The Bartlett's test has an assumption of normality, thus one should obtain the information if the distribution of the tested variable had a normal distribution.

We will use <%=ifelse(length(resp) < 5000, "_Shapiro-Wilk_, ", "")%>_Lilliefors_ and _Anderson-Darling_ tests to screen departures from normality in the response variable.

<% if (length(resp) < 5000) { %>

<%= ntest <- htest(resp, lillie.test, ad.test, shapiro.test)
k <- 0
l <- 0
m <- 0
n <- 0
p <- 0.05
if (ntest$p[1] < 0.05) {l <- k + 1}
if (ntest$p[2] < 0.05) {m <- l + 1}
if (ntest$p[3] < 0.05) {n <- m + 1}
ntest
%>
So, the conclusions we can draw with the help of test statistics: 
   
 - based on _Lilliefors test_, distribution of _<%= resp.label %>_ is <%= ifelse(ntest[1, 3] < p, "not normal", "normal") %>
   
 - _Anderson-Darling test_ confirms<%= ifelse(ntest[2, 3] < p, " violation of", "") %> normality assumption

 - according to _Shapiro-Wilk test_, the distribution of _<%= resp.label %>_ is<%= ifelse(ntest[3, 3] < p, " not", "") %> normal
 
<% } else { %>
<%= ntest <- htest(resp, lillie.test, ad.test)
k <- 0
l <- 0
m <- 0
n <- 0
p <- 0.05
if (ntest$p[1] < 0.05) {l <- k + 1}
if (ntest$p[2] < 0.05) {n <- l + 1}
ntest
%>

So, the conclusions we can draw with the help of test statistics: 
   
 - based on _Lilliefors test_, distribution of _<%= resp.label %>_ is <%= ifelse(ntest[1, 3] < p, "not normal", "normal") %>
   
 - _Anderson-Darling test_ confirms<%= ifelse(ntest[2, 3] < p, " violation of", "") %> normality assumption
<% } %>

<%= if (n > 0) {
sprintf("As you can see, the applied tests %s.", ifelse(n > 1, "confirm departures from normality", "yield different results on hypotheses of normality, so you may want to stick with one you find most appropriate or you trust the most.")) 
} else { 
sprintf("reject departures from normality") 
} 
%>

# Test results

After checking the assumptions let's see what the test shows us!

<%=
bartlett <- function(resp) bartlett.test(resp, group)
h <- htest(resp, bartlett)
h
p <- .05
%>

According to the _Bartlett's test_, the variance of the _<%= resp.label %>_ across the groups of _<%= group.label %>_ <%= ifelse(h[1, 3] < p, "significantly differs", "does not differs significantly") %>.

We can conclude that, because <%= ifelse(h[1, 3] < p,"the p-value is smaller than 0.05.","the p-value is higher than 0.05.")%>
