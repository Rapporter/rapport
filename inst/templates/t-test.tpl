Title:          t-test Template
Author:         Aleksandar BlagotiÄ‡
Description:    A t-test report with table of descriptives, diagnostic tests and t-test specific statistics.
Packages:       nortest
Data required:  TRUE
Example:        rapport("t-test", ius2008, x = "leisure", y = "gender")
                rapport("t-test", ius2008, x = "leisure", mu = 3.2)

x         | *numeric    | X variable          | Dependent (response) variable
y         | variable    | Y variable          | Independent variable (factor, or another numeric)
alter     | two.sided,less,greater | Alternative hypothesis | Whether two-sided, greater or less variant will be applied
mu        | number      | Mean value          | Mean value for one-sample t-test
paired    | FALSE       | Paired t-test       | Carry out paired t-test or not
var.equal | FALSE       | Variance equality   | Equal variances assumed: choose automatically or not
ci.level  | number=0.95 | Confidence interval | Confidence interval level

# Introduction

In a nutshell, _t-test_ is a statistical test that assesses hypothesis of equality of two means. But in theory, any hypothesis test that yields statistic which follows [_t-distribution_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution) can be considered a _t-test_. The most common usage of _t-test_ is to:

 - compare the mean of a variable with given test mean value - **one-sample _t-test_**
 - compare means of two variables from independent samples - **independent samples _t-test_**
 - compare means of two variables from dependent samples - **paired-samples _t-test_**

# Overview

<%= capitalise(variant) %> _t-test_ is carried out with <%= p(x.label) %> as dependent variable<%= if (!is.null(y)) sprintf(", and %s as independent variable", p(y.label)) else ""%>. Confidence interval is set to <%= pct(ci.level * 100, 0) %>. <% if (!is.null(variant)) sprintf("Equality of variances %s assumed.", ifelse(var.equal, "was", "wasn't")) else "" %>

# Descriptives

In order to get more insight on the underlying data, a table of basic descriptive statistics is displayed below.

<%=
rp.desc(x, y, c(min, max, mean, sd, var, median, IQR, skewness, kurtosis))
%>

# Diagnostics

Since _t-test_ is a parametric technique, it sets some basic assumptions on distribution shape: it has to be _normal_ (or approximately normal). A few normality test are to be applied, in order to screen possible departures from normality. 

## Normality Tests

We will use _Shapiro-Wilk_, _Lilliefors_ and _Anderson-Darling_ tests to screen departures from normality in the response variable (<%= p(x.label) %>). 

<%=
(ntest <- htest(x, shapiro.test, lillie.test, ad.test, colnames = c("N", "p")))
%>

As you can see, applied tests <%= ifelse(all(ntest$p < .05), "confirm departures from normality", "yield different results on hypotheses of normality, so you may want to stick with one you find most appropriate or you trust the most.") %>.


# Results

<%= tt$method %> was applied, and significant differences <%= ifelse(tt$p.value < 1 - ci.level, "weren't", "were") %> found.

<%=
with(tt, data.frame(statistic, df = parameter, p = p.value, `CI(lower)` = conf.int[1], `CI(upper)` = conf.int[2], check.names = FALSE))
%>
