Installing Pandoc
=================

As the main purpose of `rapport` is to export the template-based reports to
nicely formatted documents - it is highly recommended to install Pandoc as 
backend for that:

In order to export templates to our factory default HTML design
(https://rapporter.github.io/rapport), and use other formats (like pdf, odt, 
docx etc.), install pandoc from: 

    http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/installing.html

We recommend using the development version of pandoc which has bunch of
new features:

Unfortunatelly Linux distributions tend to ship a really outdated version of
Pandoc, so it is highly recommended to build from sources with `cabal-install`.

Development version
===================

Besides CRAN release you can grab the latest build from GitHub:
    https://github.com/rapporter/rapport

That nifty function of `devtools` package might speed up installing dev version:

    library(devtools)
    install_github('rapport', 'rapporter')

Or you can also download sources in a zip and build the package manually:
    https://github.com/rapporter/rapport/zipball/master

To do so, please extract archive to an empty directory and run the following
commands on a unix-like system:

    R CMD build rapport
    R CMD INSTALL <path to .tar.gz file>

If you're running R on Windows, you need to install Rtools:
    http://cran.stat.ucla.edu/bin/windows/Rtools/

Once you have installed it, and issue following commands in command prompt:

    R CMD build --binary <path to .tar.gz file>
    R CMD INSTALL <path to .zip file>
