\details{
However, this dataset does not contain the original data, as some random noise is added afterwards, in order to demonstrate functionality of \emph{rapport} helpers.

Dataset variables can be divided into 3 sets: \emph{demographic data}, \emph{Internet usage aspects} and \emph{application usage/content preference}.

\strong{Demographic variables}

\itemize{
    \item \emph{gender} - respondent's gender (factor with 2 levels: "male" and "female")
    \item \emph{age} - respondent's age
    \item \emph{dwell} - dwelling (factor with 3 levels: "village", "small town" and "city")
    \item \emph{student} - is respondent a student? (factor with 2 levels: "no" and "yes")
    \item \emph{partner} - partnership status (factor with 3 levels: "single", "in a relationship" and "married")
}

}
