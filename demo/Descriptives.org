** Description

This template will return descriptive statistics of a numerical or
frequency table of a categorical variable.

*** /gender/ ("Gender")

The dataset has /709/ observations with /673/ valid values (missing:
/36/).

| gender   | N     | %       | Cumul. N   | Cumul. %   |
|----------+-------+---------+------------+------------|
| male     | 410   | 60.92   | 410        | 60.92      |
| female   | 263   | 39.08   | 673        | 100        |
| Total    | 673   | 100     | 673        | 100        |
#+CAPTION: Frequency table: Gender

The most frequent value is /male/.

** Description

This template will return descriptive statistics of a numerical or
frequency table of a categorical variable.

*** /age/ ("Age")

The dataset has /709/ observations with /677/ valid values (missing:
/32/).

**** Base statistics

| Variable   | mean    | sd      | var     |
|------------+---------+---------+---------|
| Age        | 24.57   | 6.849   | 46.91   |
#+CAPTION: Descriptives: Age

The [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation][standard
deviation]] equals to /6.849/ (variance: /46.91/), which shows the
unstandardized degree of
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_(statistics)][homogenity]]:
how much variation exists from the average. The
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean][expected value]] is around /24.57/,
somewhere between /24.06/ and /25.09/ with the standard error of
/0.2632/.

The highest value found in the dataset is /58/, which is exactly /3.625/
times higher than the minimum (/16/). The difference between the two is
described by the
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(statistics)][range]]: /42/.

**** Chart

A [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram][histogram]] visually shows
the
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution][distribution]]
of the dataset based on artificially allocated
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_frequency][frequencies]].
Each bar represents a theoretical interval of the data, where the height
shows the count or density.

If we /suppose/ that /Age/ is not near to the
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution][normal
distribution]] (see for example
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness][skewness]]: /1.925/,
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurtosis][kurtosis]]: /4.463/), checking
the median (/23/) might be a better option instead of the mean. The
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range][interquartile
range]] (/6/) measures the statistics dispersion of the variable
(similar to standard deviation) based on median.

*** /hp/

The dataset has /32/ observations with /32/ valid values (missing: /0/).

**** Base statistics

| Variable   | mean    | sd      | var    |
|------------+---------+---------+--------|
| hp         | 146.7   | 68.56   | 4701   |
#+CAPTION: Descriptives: hp

The [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation][standard
deviation]] equals to /68.56/ (variance: /4701/), which shows the
unstandardized degree of
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_(statistics)][homogenity]]:
how much variation exists from the average. The
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean][expected value]] is around /146.7/,
somewhere between /122.9/ and /170.4/ with the standard error of
/12.12/.

The highest value found in the dataset is /335/, which is exactly
/6.442/ times higher than the minimum (/52/). The difference between the
two is described by the
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(statistics)][range]]: /283/.

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution][normal
distribution]] (see for example
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness][skewness]]: /0.726/,
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurtosis][kurtosis]]: /-0.1356/),
checking the median (/123/) might be a better option instead of the
mean. The
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range][interquartile
range]] (/83.5/) measures the statistics dispersion of the variable
(similar to standard deviation) based on median.
