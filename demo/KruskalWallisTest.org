** Description

In this template Rapporter will present you Kruskal Wallis test.

*** Introduction

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal-Wallis][Kruskal-Wallis test]] is
a non-parametric statistical test that assesses hypothesis of equality
of two independent sample's/variabels' variances. Most of the time it's
being used beacuse the normality assumptions didn't meet for the
samples/variables, but we need the assumption of the equal variances, so
it can be an alternative of the Two-sample t-test. Significant result
means difference between the samples/variables.

| Test statistic   | df   | P value              |
|------------------+------+----------------------|
| 1010             | 1    | /1.056e-221/ * * *   |
#+CAPTION: Kruskal-Wallis test for /Age/ and /Internet usage for
educational purposes (hours per day)/

As you can see in the table the test's degrees of freedom is /1/, the
joint test-statistic is /1010/, so the p-value of the Kruskal-Wallis
test is /1.056e-221/. Thus we can reject the assumption of the equal
variances.

As you can see in the table the test's degrees of freedom is /1/, the
joint test-statistic is /47.28/, so the p-value of the Kruskal-Wallis
test is /6.14e-12/. Thus we can reject the assumption of the equal
