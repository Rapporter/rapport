** Description

This template demonstrates the basic features of rapport. We all hope
you will like it!

*** Début

Hello, world!

I have just specified a /Variable/ in this template named to *leisure*.
The label of this variable is "Internet usage in leisure time (hours per
day)".

And wow, the mean of /leisure/ is /3.199/!

By checking out the
[[https://github.com/aL3xa/rapport/blob/master/inst/templates/example.tpl][sources
of this template]], you could see that we used all =BRCATCODE=s above
from =brew= syntax. =BRCODE= tags are useful when you want to loop
through something or optionally add or remove a part of the template. A
really easy example of this: if =desc= input equals to =TRUE=, then the
resulting report would have that chunk, if set to =FALSE=, it would be
left our.

**** Descriptive statistics

| Min.    | 1st Qu.   | Median   | Mean    | 3rd Qu.   | Max.     | NA's   |
|---------+-----------+----------+---------+-----------+----------+--------|
| 0.000   | 2.000     | 3.000    | 3.199   | 4.000     | 12.000   | 37     |

The 5 highest values are: /12/, /12/, /10/, /10/ and /10/.
