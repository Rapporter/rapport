In this template Rapporter will present you Multidimensional Scaling.

### Introduction

[Multidimensional-scaling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_scaling)
is a technique which gives us a visual representation about the
distances between the observations.

### MDS

Below you can see a plot, that presents you the distance between the
observations, which was calculated based on *Age*, *Internet usage for
educational purposes (hours per day)* and *Internet usage in leisure
time (hours per day)*.

##### What can be seen here?

###### Outsiders

84 differs the most from the others, and 8 seems to be the most "common"
observation, which lie nearest to all other observations.

###### Outsider Pairs

*284* and *84* (8.02) are the "furthest", *280* and *1* (0) are the
"nearest" to each other.

###### In General

Now let's see which observations can be said statistically far/similar
to each other in general. The *16* pairs with the biggest differences
and the *10* pairs with the smallest differences will be presented. In
the brackets you can see the amount of the distances between two
observations.

There are *17* observations which are the most similar, and equal in the
same time, that is a higher number than the wanted *16*, thus will not
be reported one-by-one. Set *17* as parameter *max.dist.num* to check
the pairs if you are interested.

There are *318* observations which are the most similar and equal in the
same time, that is a higher number than the wanted *10*, thus will not
be reported one-by-one. Set *318* as parameter *min.dist.num* to check
the pairs if you are interested.

Now let's see which observations can be said statistically far/similar
to each other in general. The *17* pairs with the biggest differences
and the *30* pairs with the smallest differences will be presented. In
the brackets you can see the amount of the distances between two
observations.

According to the used variables (*Age*, *Internet usage for educational
purposes (hours per day)* and *Internet usage in leisure time (hours per
day)*) the *17* furthest pair of observations are:

-   *284* and *84* (8.02)
-   *224* and *84* (7.87)
-   *230* and *84* (7.84)
-   *84* and *68* (7.81)
-   *463* and *84* (7.79)
-   *583* and *84* (7.79)
-   *582* and *84* (7.72)
-   *122* and *84* (7.72)
-   *460* and *84* (7.72)
-   *606* and *84* (7.7)
-   *607* and *84* (7.7)
-   *128* and *84* (7.69)
-   *253* and *84* (7.69)
-   *84* and *41* (7.69)
-   *269* and *84* (7.65)
-   *376* and *84* (7.63)
-   *506* and *84* (7.63)

There are *318* observations which are the most similar and equal in the
same time, that is a higher number than the wanted *30*, thus will not
be reported one-by-one. Set *318* as parameter *min.dist.num* to check
the pairs if you are interested.

##### What can be seen here?

###### Outsiders

Honda Civic differs the most from the others, and Ferrari Dino seems to
be the most "common" observation, which lie nearest to all other
observations.

###### Outsider Pairs

*Honda Civic* and *Cadillac Fleetwood* (5.48) are the "furthest", *Mazda
RX4 Wag* and *Mazda RX4* (0) are the "nearest" to each other.

###### In General

Now let's see which observations can be said statistically far/similar
to each other in general. The *17* pairs with the biggest differences
and the *30* pairs with the smallest differences will be presented. In
the brackets you can see the amount of the distances between two

According to the used variables (*drat*, *cyl* and *mpg*) the *17*
furthest pair of observations are:
