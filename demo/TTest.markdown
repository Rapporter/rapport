A t-test report with table of descriptives, diagnostic tests and t-test
specific statistics.

### Introduction

In a nutshell, *t-test* is a statistical test that assesses hypothesis
of equality of two means. But in theory, any hypothesis test that yields
statistic which follows
[*t-distribution*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution)
can be considered a *t-test*. The most common usage of *t-test* is to:

-   compare the mean of a variable with given test mean value -
    **one-sample *t-test***
-   compare means of two variables from independent samples -
    **independent samples *t-test***
-   compare means of two variables from dependent samples -
    **paired-samples *t-test***

### Overview

Independent samples *t-test* is carried out with *Internet usage in
leisure time (hours per day)* as dependent variable, and *Gender* as
independent variable. Confidence interval is set to 95%. Equality of
variances wasn't assumed.

### Descriptives

In order to get more insight on the underlying data, a table of basic
descriptive statistics is displayed below.

   Gender    min    max    mean     sd    var    median    IQR
  --------- ------ ------ ------- ------ ------ --------- -----
    male      0      12    3.27   1.953  3.816      3       3
   female     0      12    3.064  2.355  5.544      2       3

  : Table continues below

   skewness    kurtosis
  ----------- -----------
    0.9443      0.9858
     1.398       1.87

### Diagnostics

Since *t-test* is a parametric technique, it sets some basic assumptions
on distribution shape: it has to be *normal* (or approximately normal).
A few normality test are to be applied, in order to screen possible
departures from normality.

#### Normality Tests

We will use *Shapiro-Wilk*, *Lilliefors* and *Anderson-Darling* tests to
screen departures from normality in the response variable (*Internet
usage in leisure time (hours per day)*).

  ----------------------------------------------
               N                  p    
  ---------------------------- ------- ---------
  Shapiro-Wilk normality test  0.9001  1.618e-20

           Lilliefors           0.168  3e-52
      (Kolmogorov-Smirnov)             
         normality test                

   Anderson-Darling normality   18.75  7.261e-44
              test                     
  ----------------------------------------------

As you can see, applied tests yield different results on hypotheses of
normality, so you may want to stick with one you find most appropriate
or you trust the most..

### Results

Welch Two Sample t-test was applied, and significant differences were
found.

            statistic     df      p     CI(lower)    CI(upper)
  -------- ------------ ------ ------- ------------ ------------
