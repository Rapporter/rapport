** Description

In this template Rapporter will present you Multidimensional Scaling.

*** Introduction

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_scaling][Multidimensional-scaling]]
is a technique which gives us a visual representation about the
distances between the observations.

*** MDS

Below you can see a plot, that presents you the distance between the
observations, which was calculated based on /Age/, /Internet usage for
educational purposes (hours per day)/ and /Internet usage in leisure
time (hours per day)/.

***** What can be seen here?

****** Outsiders

84 differs the most from the others, and 8 seems to be the most "common"
observation, which lie nearest to all other observations.

****** Outsider Pairs

/284/ and /84/ (8.02) are the "furthest", /280/ and /1/ (0) are the
"nearest" to each other.

****** In General

Now let's see which observations can be said statistically far/similar
to each other in general. The /16/ pairs with the biggest differences
and the /10/ pairs with the smallest differences will be presented. In
the brackets you can see the amount of the distances between two
observations.

There are /17/ observations which are the most similar, and equal in the
same time, that is a higher number than the wanted /16/, thus will not
be reported one-by-one. Set /17/ as parameter /max.dist.num/ to check
the pairs if you are interested.

There are /318/ observations which are the most similar and equal in the
same time, that is a higher number than the wanted /10/, thus will not
be reported one-by-one. Set /318/ as parameter /min.dist.num/ to check
the pairs if you are interested.

Now let's see which observations can be said statistically far/similar
to each other in general. The /17/ pairs with the biggest differences
and the /30/ pairs with the smallest differences will be presented. In
the brackets you can see the amount of the distances between two
observations.

According to the used variables (/Age/, /Internet usage for educational
purposes (hours per day)/ and /Internet usage in leisure time (hours per
day)/) the /17/ furthest pair of observations are:

-  /284/ and /84/ (8.02)
-  /224/ and /84/ (7.87)
-  /230/ and /84/ (7.84)
-  /84/ and /68/ (7.81)
-  /463/ and /84/ (7.79)
-  /583/ and /84/ (7.79)
-  /582/ and /84/ (7.72)
-  /122/ and /84/ (7.72)
-  /460/ and /84/ (7.72)
-  /606/ and /84/ (7.7)
-  /607/ and /84/ (7.7)
-  /128/ and /84/ (7.69)
-  /253/ and /84/ (7.69)
-  /84/ and /41/ (7.69)
-  /269/ and /84/ (7.65)
-  /376/ and /84/ (7.63)
-  /506/ and /84/ (7.63)

***** What can be seen here?

****** Outsiders

Honda Civic differs the most from the others, and Ferrari Dino seems to
be the most "common" observation, which lie nearest to all other
observations.

****** Outsider Pairs

/Honda Civic/ and /Cadillac Fleetwood/ (5.48) are the "furthest", /Mazda
RX4 Wag/ and /Mazda RX4/ (0) are the "nearest" to each other.
