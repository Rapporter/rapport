** Description

A t-test report with table of descriptives, diagnostic tests and t-test
specific statistics.

*** Introduction

In a nutshell, /t-test/ is a statistical test that assesses hypothesis
of equality of two means. But in theory, any hypothesis test that yields
statistic which follows
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution][/t-distribution/]]
can be considered a /t-test/. The most common usage of /t-test/ is to:

-  compare the mean of a variable with given test mean value -
   *one-sample /t-test/*
-  compare means of two variables from independent samples -
   *independent samples /t-test/*
-  compare means of two variables from dependent samples -
   *paired-samples /t-test/*

*** Overview

Independent samples /t-test/ is carried out with /Internet usage in
leisure time (hours per day)/ as dependent variable, and /Gender/ as
independent variable. Confidence interval is set to 95%. Equality of
variances wasn't assumed.

*** Descriptives

In order to get more insight on the underlying data, a table of basic
descriptive statistics is displayed below.

| Gender   | min   | max   | mean    | sd      | var     | median   | IQR   |
|----------+-------+-------+---------+---------+---------+----------+-------|
| male     | 0     | 12    | 3.270   | 1.953   | 3.816   | 3        | 3     |
| female   | 0     | 12    | 3.064   | 2.355   | 5.544   | 2        | 3     |

| skewness   | kurtosis   |
|------------+------------|
| 0.9443     | 0.9858     |
| 1.3979     | 1.8696     |

*** Diagnostics

Since /t-test/ is a parametric technique, it sets some basic assumptions
on distribution shape: it has to be /normal/ (or approximately normal).
A few normality test are to be applied, in order to screen possible
departures from normality.

**** Normality Tests

We will use /Shapiro-Wilk/, /Lilliefors/ and /Anderson-Darling/ tests to
screen departures from normality in the response variable (/Internet
usage in leisure time (hours per day)/).

| N                                                | p         | NA          |
|--------------------------------------------------+-----------+-------------|
| Shapiro-Wilk normality test                      | 0.9001    | 1.617e-20   |
| Lilliefors (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) normality test   | 0.1680    | 3.000e-52   |
| Anderson-Darling normality test                  | 18.7530   | 7.261e-44   |

As you can see, applied tests yield different results on hypotheses of
normality, so you may want to stick with one you find most appropriate
or you trust the most..

*** Results

Welch Two Sample t-test was applied, and significant differences were
found.

|       | statistic   | df      | p        | CI(lower)   | CI(upper)   |
|-------+-------------+---------+----------+-------------+-------------|
| *t*   | 1.148       | 457.9   | 0.2514   | -0.1463     | 0.5576      |
