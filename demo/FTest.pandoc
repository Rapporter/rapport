## Description



This template will run an F-test to check if two continuous variables have the same means.







### Introduction





F test compares the means of two continuous variables. In other words it shows if their means were statistically different.
We should be careful, while using the F test, because of the strict normality assumption, where strict means approximately normal ditribution is not enough to satisfy that.







### Normality assumption check (_Internet usage for educational purposes (hours per day)_)





The [_Shapiro-Wilk test_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapiro%E2%80%93Wilk_test), the [_Lilliefors test_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilliefors_test) and the [_Anderson-Darling test_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_Darling_test) help us to decide if the above-mentioned assumption can be accepted of the _Internet usage for educational purposes (hours per day)_.


































-------------------------------------------------
          Method             Statistic   p-value 
--------------------------- ----------- ---------
        Lilliefors            0.2223    2.243e-92
   (Kolmogorov-Smirnov)                          
      normality test                             

Anderson-Darling normality     42.04    3.31e-90 
           test                                  

Shapiro-Wilk normality test   0.7985    6.366e-28
-------------------------------------------------




So, the conclusions we can draw with the help of test statistics: 
   
 - based on _Lilliefors test_, distribution of _Internet usage for educational purposes (hours per day)_ is not normal
   
 - _Anderson-Darling test_ confirms violation of normality assumption

 - according to _Shapiro-Wilk test_, the distribution of _Internet usage for educational purposes (hours per day)_ is not normal
 





As you can see, the applied tests confirm departures from normality.








### Normality assumption check (_Age_)





The [_Shapiro-Wilk test_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapiro%E2%80%93Wilk_test), the [_Lilliefors test_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilliefors_test) and the [_Anderson-Darling test_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_Darling_test) help us to decide if the above-mentioned assumption can be accepted of the _Internet usage for educational purposes (hours per day)_.

           test                                  

Shapiro-Wilk normality test   0.8216    9.445e-27
-------------------------------------------------




So, the conclusions we can draw with the help of test statistics: 
   
 - based on _Lilliefors test_, distribution of _Age_ is not normal
   
 - _Anderson-Darling test_ confirms violation of normality assumption

 - according to _Shapiro-Wilk test_, the distribution of _Age_ is not normal
 





As you can see, the applied tests confirm departures from normality.





_In this case it is advisable to run a more robust test, then the F-test._







## Description



This template will run an F-test to check if two continuous variables have the same means.







### Introduction





F test compares the means of two continuous variables. In other words it shows if their means were statistically different.
We should be careful, while using the F test, because of the strict normality assumption, where strict means approximately normal ditribution is not enough to satisfy that.






### The F-test





Here is the the result of the _F test_ to compare the means of _Internet usage for educational purposes (hours per day)_ and _Age_.

















--------------------------------------------
       Method          Statistic   p-value  
--------------------- ----------- ----------
F test to compare two   0.08618   3.772e-180
      variances                             
--------------------------------------------





We can see from the table (in the p-value coloumn) that there is a significant difference between the means of _Internet usage for educational purposes (hours per day)_ and _Age_.

Here is the the result of the _F test_ to compare the means of _cyl_ and _drat_.

      variances                            
-------------------------------------------





We can see from the table (in the p-value coloumn) that there is a significant difference between the means of _cyl_ and _drat_.
