** Description

This template will run an F-test to check if two continuous variables
have the same means.

*** Introduction

F test compares the means of two continuous variables. In other words it
shows if their means were statistically different. We should be careful,
while using the F test, because of the strict normality assumption,
where strict means approximately normal ditribution is not enough to
satisfy that.

*** Normality assumption check (/Internet usage for educational purposes
(hours per day)/)

The
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapiro%E2%80%93Wilk_test][/Shapiro-Wilk
test/]], the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilliefors_test][/Lilliefors
test/]] and the
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_Darling_test][/Anderson-Darling
test/]] help us to decide if the above-mentioned assumption can be
accepted of the /Internet usage for educational purposes (hours per
day)/.

| Method                                           | Statistic   | p-value     |
|--------------------------------------------------+-------------+-------------|
| Lilliefors (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) normality test   | 0.2223      | 2.243e-92   |
| Anderson-Darling normality test                  | 42.04       | 3.31e-90    |
| Shapiro-Wilk normality test                      | 0.7985      | 6.366e-28   |

So, the conclusions we can draw with the help of test statistics:

-  based on /Lilliefors test/, distribution of /Internet usage for
   educational purposes (hours per day)/ is not normal

-  /Anderson-Darling test/ confirms violation of normality assumption

-  according to /Shapiro-Wilk test/, the distribution of /Internet usage
   for educational purposes (hours per day)/ is not normal

As you can see, the applied tests confirm departures from normality.

*** Normality assumption check (/Age/)

The
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapiro%E2%80%93Wilk_test][/Shapiro-Wilk
test/]], the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilliefors_test][/Lilliefors
test/]] and the
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_Darling_test][/Anderson-Darling
test/]] help us to decide if the above-mentioned assumption can be
accepted of the /Internet usage for educational purposes (hours per
day)/.

| Method                                           | Statistic   | p-value     |
|--------------------------------------------------+-------------+-------------|
| Lilliefors (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) normality test   | 0.17        | 6.193e-54   |
| Anderson-Darling normality test                  | 32.16       | 1.26e-71    |
| Shapiro-Wilk normality test                      | 0.8216      | 9.445e-27   |

So, the conclusions we can draw with the help of test statistics:

-  based on /Lilliefors test/, distribution of /Age/ is not normal

-  /Anderson-Darling test/ confirms violation of normality assumption

-  according to /Shapiro-Wilk test/, the distribution of /Age/ is not
   normal

As you can see, the applied tests confirm departures from normality.

/In this case it is advisable to run a more robust test, then the
F-test./

** Description

This template will run an F-test to check if two continuous variables
have the same means.

*** Introduction

F test compares the means of two continuous variables. In other words it
shows if their means were statistically different. We should be careful,
while using the F test, because of the strict normality assumption,
where strict means approximately normal ditribution is not enough to
satisfy that.

*** The F-test

Here is the the result of the /F test/ to compare the means of /Internet
usage for educational purposes (hours per day)/ and /Age/.

| Method                            | Statistic   | p-value      |
|-----------------------------------+-------------+--------------|
| F test to compare two variances   | 0.08618     | 3.772e-180   |

We can see from the table (in the p-value coloumn) that there is a
significant difference between the means of /Internet usage for
educational purposes (hours per day)/ and /Age/.

Here is the the result of the /F test/ to compare the means of /cyl/ and
/drat/.

|-----------------------------------+-------------+-------------|
| F test to compare two variances   | 11.16       | 1.461e-09   |

We can see from the table (in the p-value coloumn) that there is a
significant difference between the means of /cyl/ and /drat/.
