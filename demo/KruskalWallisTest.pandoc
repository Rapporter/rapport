## Description



In this template Rapporter will present you Kruskal Wallis test.







### Introduction





[Kruskal-Wallis test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal-Wallis) is a non-parametric statistical test that assesses hypothesis of equality of two independent sample's/variabels' variances. Most of the time it's being used beacuse the normality assumptions didn't meet for the samples/variables, but we need the assumption of the equal variances, so it can be an alternative of the Two-sample t-test.
Significant result means difference between the samples/variables.












----------------------------------------
 Test statistic   df       P value      
---------------- ---- ------------------
      1010        1   _1.056e-221_ * * *
----------------------------------------

Table: Kruskal-Wallis test for _Age_ and _Internet usage for educational purposes (hours per day)_














As you can see in the table the test's degrees of freedom is _1_, the joint test-statistic is _1010_, so the p-value of the Kruskal-Wallis test is _1.056e-221_. Thus we can reject the assumption of the equal variances.

As you can see in the table the test's degrees of freedom is _1_, the joint test-statistic is _47.28_, so the p-value of the Kruskal-Wallis test is _6.14e-12_. Thus we can reject the assumption of the equal variances.
