** Description

Overview of several normality tests and diagnostic plots that can screen
departures from normality.

*** Introduction

In statistics, /normality/ refers to an assumption that the distribution
of a random variable follows /normal/ (/Gaussian/) distribution. Because
of its bell-like shape, it's also known as the /"bell curve"/. The
formula for /normal distribution/ is:

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi{}\sigma{}^2}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu{})^2}{2\sigma{}^2}}$$

/Normal distribution/ belongs to a /location-scale family/ of
distributions, as it's defined two parameters:

-  $\mu$ - /mean/ or /expectation/ (location parameter)
-  $\sigma^2$ - /variance/ (scale parameter)

*** Normality Tests

**** Overview

Various hypothesis tests can be applied in order to test if the
distribution of given random variable violates normality assumption.
These procedures test the H_{0} that provided variable's distribution is
/normal/. At this point only few such tests will be covered: the ones
that are available in =stats= package (which comes bundled with default
R installation) and =nortest= package that is
[[http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nortest/index.html][available]]
on CRAN.

-  *Shapiro-Wilk test* is a powerful normality test appropriate for
   small samples. In R, it's implemented in =shapiro.test= function
   available in =stats= package.
-  *Lilliefors test* is a modification of /Kolmogorov-Smirnov test/
   appropriate for testing normality when parameters or normal
   distribution ($\mu$, $\sigma^2$) are not known. =lillie.test=
   function is located in =nortest= package.
-  *Anderson-Darling test* is one of the most powerful normality tests
   as it will detect the most of departures from normality. You can find
   =ad.test= function in =nortest= package.

**** Results

Here you can see the results of applied normality tests (/p-values/ less
than 0.05 indicate significant discrepancies):

We will use /Shapiro-Wilk/, /Lilliefors/ and /Anderson-Darling/ tests to
screen departures from normality in the response variable.

| Method                                           | Statistic   | p-value     |
|--------------------------------------------------+-------------+-------------|
| Lilliefors (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) normality test   | 0.168       | 3e-52       |
| Anderson-Darling normality test                  | 18.75       | 7.261e-44   |
| Shapiro-Wilk normality test                      | 0.9001      | 1.618e-20   |

So, the conclusions we can draw with the help of test statistics:

-  based on /Lilliefors test/, distribution of /Internet usage in
   leisure time (hours per day)/ is not normal

-  /Anderson-Darling test/ confirms violation of normality assumption

-  according to /Shapiro-Wilk test/, the distribution of /Internet usage
   in leisure time (hours per day)/ is not normal

As you can see, the applied tests confirm departures from normality.

*** Diagnostic Plots

There are various plots that can help you decide about the normality of
the distribution. Only a few most commonly used plots will be shown:
/histogram/, /Q-Q plot/ and /kernel density plot/.

**** Histogram

/Histogram/ was first introduced by /Karl Pearson/ and it's probably the
most popular plot for depicting the probability distribution of a random
variable. However, the decision depends on number of bins, so it can
sometimes be misleading. If the variable distribution is normal, bins
should resemble the "bell-like" shape.

**** Q-Q Plot

"Q" in /Q-Q plot/ stands for /quantile/, as this plot compares empirical
and theoretical distribution (in this case, /normal/ distribution) by
plotting their quantiles against each other. For normal distribution,
plotted dots should approximate a "straight", =x = y= line.

[[plots/NormalityTest-3-hires.png][[[plots/NormalityTest-3.png]]]]

**** Kernel Density Plot

/Kernel density plot/ is a plot of smoothed /empirical distribution
function/. As such, it provides good insight about the shape of the
distribution. For normal distributions, it should resemble the well
known "bell shape".
