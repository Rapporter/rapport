## Description



In this template Rapporter will present you GLM.













### Introduction





[Generalized Linear Model (GLM)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model) is a generalization of the ordinary [Linear Regression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression). While using GLM we don't need the assumption of normality for response variables. There are two basic ideas of the model: It allows the linear model to be related to the response variable via a link function and the magnitude of the variance of each measurement to be a function of its predicted value. An extinsion to the GLM is the [Hierarchical generalized linear model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_generalized_linear_model).





















#Overview




Multivariate-General Linear Model was carried out, with _Internet usage in leisure time (hours per day)_ and _Internet usage for educational purposes (hours per day)_ as independent variables, and _Age_ as a dependent variable.
The [interaction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction) between the independent variables was taken into account.

 **(Intercept)**    3.198      0.02122      150.7       0

Table: Fitting General Linear Model: age based on _leisure_ and _edu_








From the table one can see that 



* (Intercept) has significant effect on the dependent variable, the p-value of that is 0 
* leisure has significant effect on the dependent variable, the p-value of that is 0.001 
* leisure:edu has significant effect on the dependent variable, the p-value of that is 0.013
