** Description

This template will return descriptive statistics of a numerical or
frequency table of a categorical variable.

*** /gender/ ("Gender")

The dataset has /709/ observations with /673/ valid values (missing:
/36/).

| gender   | N     | %        | Cumul. N   | Cumul. %   |
|----------+-------+----------+------------+------------|
| male     | 410   | 60.92    | 410        | 60.92      |
| female   | 263   | 39.08    | 673        | 100.00     |
| Total    | 673   | 100.00   | 673        | 100.00     |
#+CAPTION: Frequency table: Gender

The most frequent value is /male/.

**** Charts

[[plots/descriptives-1-hires.png][[[plots/descriptives-1.png]]]]

It seems that the highest value is /2/ which is exactly /2/ times higher
than the smallest value (/1/).

** Description

This template will return descriptive statistics of a numerical or
frequency table of a categorical variable.

*** /age/ ("Age")

The dataset has /709/ observations with /677/ valid values (missing:
/32/).

**** Base statistics

| Variable   | mean    | sd      | var     |
|------------+---------+---------+---------|
| Age        | 24.57   | 6.849   | 46.91   |
#+CAPTION: Descriptives: Age

The standard deviation is /6.849/ (variance: /46.91/). The expected
value is around /24.57/, somewhere between /24.06/ and /25.09/ with the
standard error of /0.2632/.

**** Charts

[[plots/descriptives-2-hires.png][[[plots/descriptives-2.png]]]]

It seems that the highest value is /58/ which is exactly /3.625/ times
higher than the smallest value (/16/).

If we /suppose/ that /Age/ is not near to a normal distribution
(skewness: /1.925/, kurtosis: /4.463/), checking the median (/23/) might
be a better option instead of the mean. The interquartile range (/6/)
measures the statistics dispersion of the variable (similar to standard
deviation) based on median.

This template will return descriptive statistics of a numerical or
frequency table of a categorical variable.

*** /hp/

The dataset has /32/ observations with /32/ valid values (missing: /0/).

**** Base statistics

| Variable   | mean    | sd      | var    |
|------------+---------+---------+--------|
| hp         | 146.7   | 68.56   | 4701   |
#+CAPTION: Descriptives: hp

The standard deviation is /68.56/ (variance: /4701/). The expected value
is around /146.7/, somewhere between /122.9/ and /170.4/ with the
standard error of /12.12/.

**** Charts

[[plots/descriptives-3-hires.png][[[plots/descriptives-3.png]]]]

It seems that the highest value is /335/ which is exactly /6.442/ times
higher than the smallest value (/52/).

If we /suppose/ that /hp/ is not near to a normal distribution
(skewness: /0.726/, kurtosis: /-0.1356/), checking the median (/123/)
might be a better option instead of the mean. The interquartile range
(/83.5/) measures the statistics dispersion of the variable (similar to
standard deviation) based on median.
