** Description

Returning the Chi-squared test of two given variables with count,
percentages and Pearson's residuals table.

*** Variable description

Two variables specified:

-  "gender" ("Gender") with /673/ and
-  "dwell" ("Dwelling") with /662/ valid values.

*** Counts

#+CAPTION: Counted values

Most of the cases (338) can be found in "male-city" categories. Row-wise
"male" holds the highest number of cases (410) while column-wise "city"
has the utmost cases (599).

*** Chi-squared test

| Test statistic   | df   | P value   |
|------------------+------+-----------|
| 16.18            | 6    | 0.01282   |
#+CAPTION: Pearson's Chi-squared test: =table=

It seems that a real association can be pointed out between /gender/ and
/dwell/ by the /Pearson's Chi-squared test/ (χ=/16.18/ at the degree of
freedom being /6/) at the significance level of /0.01282/. Based on
Goodman and Kruskal's lambda it seems that /dwell/ (λ=/0.6321/) has an
effect on /gender/ (λ=/0/) if we assume both variables to be nominal.
The association between the two variables seems to be weak based on
Cramer's V (/0.08722/).

|            | city    | small town   | village   |
|------------+---------+--------------+-----------|
| *male*     | -3.08   | 3.43         | 0.76      |
| *female*   | 3.08    | -3.43        | -0.76     |
#+CAPTION: Pearson's residuals

Based on Pearson's resuals the following cells seems interesting (with
values higher then =2= or lower then =-2=):

-  "male - city"
-  "female - city"
-  "male - small town"
-  "female - small town"

no other statistical tests were performed.
