## Description



In this template Rapporter will present you Wilcoxon test.







### Introduction





[Wilcoxon test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilcoxon_test) (or its equivalent 
the Mann-Whitney U test)  is a non-parametric statistical test which can be an alternative of the  paired Student's t-test, t-test for matched pairs, or the t-test for dependent samples. When the Wilcoxon test is used to compare two samples of values which are not paired, it makes no assumption about the shape of the distribution, only that (as null hypothesis) the distribution from which mpg was sampled is the same as the distribution from which cyl was sampled. The null hypothesis states that the variances of the variables are equal.

Table: Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction mpg and cyl








As you can see in the table the the p-value of the Wilcoxon test is _4.306e-12_, thus we can accept the assumption of the null hypothesis, so we can say that statistically the variances are equal.
