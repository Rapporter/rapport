## Description



Overview of several normality tests and diagnostic plots that can screen departures from normality.







### Introduction





In statistics, _normality_ refers to an assumption that the distribution of a random variable follows _normal_ (_Gaussian_) distribution. Because of its bell-like shape, it's also known as the _"bell curve"_. The formula for _normal distribution_ is:

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi{}\sigma{}^2}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu{})^2}{2\sigma{}^2}}$$

_Normal distribution_ belongs to a _location-scale family_ of distributions, as it's defined two parameters:

 - $\mu$ - _mean_ or _expectation_ (location parameter)
 - $\sigma^2$ - _variance_ (scale parameter)

### Normality Tests









#### Overview





Various hypothesis tests can be applied in order to test if the distribution of given random variable violates normality assumption. These procedures test the H~0~ that provided variable's distribution is _normal_. At this point only few such tests will be covered: the ones that are available in `stats` package (which comes bundled with default R installation) and `nortest` package that is [available](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nortest/index.html) on CRAN.

 - **Shapiro-Wilk test** is a powerful normality test appropriate for small samples. In R, it's implemented in `shapiro.test` function available in `stats` package.
 - **Lilliefors test** is a modification of _Kolmogorov-Smirnov test_ appropriate for testing normality when parameters or normal distribution ($\mu$, $\sigma^2$) are not known. `lillie.test` function is located in `nortest` package.
 - **Anderson-Darling test** is one of the most powerful normality tests as it will detect the most of departures from normality. You can find `ad.test` function in `nortest` package.





#### Results





Here you can see the results of applied normality tests (_p-values_ less than 0.05 indicate significant discrepancies):

We will use _Shapiro-Wilk_, _Lilliefors_ and _Anderson-Darling_ tests to screen departures from normality in the response variable. 


































-------------------------------------------------
          Method             Statistic   p-value 
--------------------------- ----------- ---------
        Lilliefors             0.168      3e-52  
   (Kolmogorov-Smirnov)

           test                                  

Shapiro-Wilk normality test   0.9001    1.618e-20
-------------------------------------------------




So, the conclusions we can draw with the help of test statistics: 
   
 - based on _Lilliefors test_, distribution of _Internet usage in leisure time (hours per day)_ is not normal
   
 - _Anderson-Darling test_ confirms violation of normality assumption

 - according to _Shapiro-Wilk test_, the distribution of _Internet usage in leisure time (hours per day)_ is not normal
 





As you can see, the applied tests confirm departures from normality.









### Diagnostic Plots





There are various plots that can help you decide about the normality of the distribution. Only a few most commonly used plots will be shown: _histogram_, _Q-Q plot_ and _kernel density plot_.





#### Histogram





_Histogram_ was first introduced by _Karl Pearson_ and it's probably the most popular plot for depicting the probability distribution of a random variable. However, the decision depends on number of bins, so it can sometimes be misleading. If the variable distribution is normal, bins should resemble the "bell-like" shape.

#### Q-Q Plot





"Q" in _Q-Q plot_ stands for _quantile_, as this plot compares empirical and theoretical distribution (in this case, _normal_ distribution) by plotting their quantiles against each other. For normal distribution, plotted dots should approximate a "straight", `x = y` line.

#### Kernel Density Plot





_Kernel density plot_ is a plot of smoothed _empirical distribution function_. As such, it provides good insight about the shape of the distribution. For normal distributions, it should resemble the well known "bell shape".
