### Introduction

[Correlation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence)
is one of the most commonly used statistical tool. With the help of that
we can get information about a possible [linear
relation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_independence) between two
variables. According to the definition of the correlation, one can call
it also as the standardized
[covariance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance).

The maximum possible value of the correlation (the so-called
[correlation
coefficient](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_coefficient))
could be 1, the minimum could be -1. In the first case there is a
perfect positive (thus in the second case there is a perfect negative)
linear relationship between the two variables, though perfect
relationships, especially in the social sciences, are quite rare. If two
variables are independent from each other, the correlation between them
is 0, but 0 correlation coefficient only means certainly a [linear
independency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence#Correlation_and_linearity).

Because extreme values occur seldom we have rule of thumbs for the
coefficients, like other fields of statistics:

-   we call two variables highly correlated if the absolute value of the
    correlation coefficient between them is higher than 0.7 and
-   we call them uncorrelated if that is smaller than 0.2.

Please note that [correlation has nothing to do with causal
models](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation),
it only shows association but not effects.

### Variable description

There are no highly correlated (r \< -0.7 or r \> 0.7) variables.

There are no uncorrelated correlated (r \< -0.2 or r \> 0.2) variables.

seems that the strongest association (r=*0.2273*) is between *edu* and
*age*.

There are no highly correlated (r \< -0.7 or r \> 0.7) variables.

Uncorrelated (-0.2 \< r \< 0.2) variables:
