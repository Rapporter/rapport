h2(#description). Description

This template will run an F-test to check if two continuous variables have the same means.

h3(#introduction). Introduction

F test compares the means of two continuous variables. In other words it shows if their means were statistically different. We should be careful, while using the F test, because of the strict normality assumption, where strict means approximately normal ditribution is not enough to satisfy that.

h3(#normality-assumption-check-internet-usage-for-educational-purposes-hours-per-day). Normality assumption check (_Internet usage for educational purposes (hours per day)_)

The "_Shapiro-Wilk test_":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapiro%E2%80%93Wilk_test, the "_Lilliefors test_":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilliefors_test and the "_Anderson-Darling test_":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_Darling_test help us to decide if the above-mentioned assumption can be accepted of the _Internet usage for educational purposes (hours per day)_.

So, the conclusions we can draw with the help of test statistics:

* based on _Lilliefors test_, distribution of _Internet usage for educational purposes (hours per day)_ is not normal
* _Anderson-Darling test_ confirms violation of normality assumption
* according to _Shapiro-Wilk test_, the distribution of _Internet usage for educational purposes (hours per day)_ is not normal

As you can see, the applied tests confirm departures from normality.

So, the conclusions we can draw with the help of test statistics:

* based on _Lilliefors test_, distribution of _Age_ is not normal
* _Anderson-Darling test_ confirms violation of normality assumption
* according to _Shapiro-Wilk test_, the distribution of _Age_ is not normal

As you can see, the applied tests confirm departures from normality.

_In this case it is advisable to run a more robust test, then the F-test._

h2(#description-1). Description

This template will run an F-test to check if two continuous variables have the same means.

h3(#introduction-1). Introduction

F test compares the means of two continuous variables. In other words it shows if their means were statistically different. We should be careful, while using the F test, because of the strict normality assumption, where strict means approximately normal ditribution is not enough to satisfy that.

h3(#the-f-test). The F-test

Here is the the result of the _F test_ to compare the means of _Internet usage for educational purposes (hours per day)_ and _Age_.

<table>

We can see from the table (in the p-value coloumn) that there is a significant difference between the means of _Internet usage for educational purposes (hours per day)_ and _Age_.
