In this template Rapporter will present you Multidimensional Scaling.

h3(#introduction). Introduction

"Multidimensional-scaling":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_scaling is a technique which gives us a visual representation about the distances between the observations.

h3(#mds). MDS

Below you can see a plot, that presents you the distance between the observations, which was calculated based on _Age_, _Internet usage for educational purposes (hours per day)_ and _Internet usage in leisure time (hours per day)_.

h6(#outsiders). Outsiders

84 differs the most from the others, and 8 seems to be the most &quot;common&quot; observation, which lie nearest to all other observations.

h6(#outsider-pairs). Outsider Pairs

_284_ and _84_ (8.02) are the &quot;furthest&quot;, _280_ and _1_ (0) are the &quot;nearest&quot; to each other.

h6(#in-general). In General

Now let's see which observations can be said statistically far/similar to each other in general. The _16_ pairs with the biggest differences and the _10_ pairs with the smallest differences will be presented. In the brackets you can see the amount of the distances between two observations.

There are _17_ observations which are the most similar, and equal in the same time, that is a higher number than the wanted _16_, thus will not be reported one-by-one. Set _17_ as parameter _max.dist.num_ to check the pairs if you are interested.

There are _318_ observations which are the most similar and equal in the same time, that is a higher number than the wanted _10_, thus will not be reported one-by-one. Set _318_ as parameter _min.dist.num_ to check the pairs if you are interested.

Now let's see which observations can be said statistically far/similar to each other in general. The _17_ pairs with the biggest differences and the _30_ pairs with the smallest differences will be presented. In the brackets you can see the amount of the distances between two observations.

According to the used variables (_Age_, _Internet usage for educational purposes (hours per day)_ and _Internet usage in leisure time (hours per day)_) the _17_ furthest pair of observations are:

* _284_ and _84_ (8.02)
* _224_ and _84_ (7.87)
* _230_ and _84_ (7.84)
* _84_ and _68_ (7.81)
* _463_ and _84_ (7.79)
* _583_ and _84_ (7.79)
* _582_ and _84_ (7.72)
* _122_ and _84_ (7.72)
* _460_ and _84_ (7.72)
* _606_ and _84_ (7.7)
* _607_ and _84_ (7.7)
* _128_ and _84_ (7.69)
* _253_ and _84_ (7.69)
* _84_ and _41_ (7.69)
* _269_ and _84_ (7.65)
* _376_ and _84_ (7.63)
* _506_ and _84_ (7.63)

There are _318_ observations which are the most similar and equal in the same time, that is a higher number than the wanted _30_, thus will not be reported one-by-one. Set _318_ as parameter _min.dist.num_ to check the pairs if you are interested.
