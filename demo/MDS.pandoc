## Description



In this template Rapporter will present you Multidimensional Scaling.








### Introduction





[Multidimensional-scaling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_scaling) is a technique which gives us a visual representation about the distances between the observations. 





### MDS





Below you can see a plot, that presents you the distance between the observations, which was calculated based on _Age_, _Internet usage for educational purposes (hours per day)_ and _Internet usage in leisure time (hours per day)_.

##### What can be seen here?









###### Outsiders















84 differs the most from the others, and 8 seems to be the most "common" observation, which lie nearest to all other observations.

























###### Outsider Pairs








_284_ and _84_ (8.02) are the "furthest", _280_ and _1_ (0) are the "nearest" to each other.





###### In General





Now let's see which observations can be said statistically far/similar to each other in general. The _16_ pairs with the biggest differences and the _10_ pairs with the smallest differences will be presented. In the brackets you can see the amount of the distances between two observations.



There are _17_ observations which are the most similar, and equal in the same time, that is a higher number than the wanted _16_, thus will not be reported one-by-one. Set _17_ as parameter _max.dist.num_ to check the pairs if you are interested.


 


There are _318_ observations which are the most similar and equal in the same time, that is a higher number than the wanted _10_, thus will not be reported one-by-one. Set _318_ as parameter _min.dist.num_ to check the pairs if you are interested.

###### In General





Now let's see which observations can be said statistically far/similar to each other in general. The _17_ pairs with the biggest differences and the _30_ pairs with the smallest differences will be presented. In the brackets you can see the amount of the distances between two observations.



According to the used variables (_Age_, _Internet usage for educational purposes (hours per day)_ and _Internet usage in leisure time (hours per day)_) the _17_ furthest pair of observations are:






  * _284_ and _84_ (8.02)
  * _224_ and _84_ (7.87)
  * _230_ and _84_ (7.84)
  * _84_ and _68_ (7.81)
  * _463_ and _84_ (7.79)
  * _583_ and _84_ (7.79)
  * _582_ and _84_ (7.72)
  * _122_ and _84_ (7.72)
  * _460_ and _84_ (7.72)
  * _606_ and _84_ (7.7)
  * _607_ and _84_ (7.7)
  * _128_ and _84_ (7.69)
  * _253_ and _84_ (7.69)
  * _84_ and _41_ (7.69)
  * _269_ and _84_ (7.65)
  * _376_ and _84_ (7.63)
  * _506_ and _84_ (7.63)

There are _318_ observations which are the most similar and equal in the same time, that is a higher number than the wanted _30_, thus will not be reported one-by-one. Set _318_ as parameter _min.dist.num_ to check the pairs if you are interested.

###### Outsiders















Honda Civic differs the most from the others, and Ferrari Dino seems to be the most "common" observation, which lie nearest to all other observations.

























###### Outsider Pairs








_Honda Civic_ and _Cadillac Fleetwood_ (5.48) are the "furthest", _Mazda RX4 Wag_ and _Mazda RX4_ (0) are the "nearest" to each other.
