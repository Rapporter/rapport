Description
-----------

This template will run an F-test to check if two continuous variables
have the same means.

### Introduction

F test compares the means of two continuous variables. In other words it
shows if their means were statistically different. We should be careful,
while using the F test, because of the strict normality assumption,
where strict means approximately normal ditribution is not enough to
satisfy that.

### Normality assumption check (*Internet usage for educational purposes (hours per day)*)

The [*Shapiro-Wilk
test*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapiro%E2%80%93Wilk_test), the
[*Lilliefors test*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilliefors_test) and
the [*Anderson-Darling
test*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_Darling_test) help us to
decide if the above-mentioned assumption can be accepted of the
*Internet usage for educational purposes (hours per day)*.

  ---------------------------------------------------
             Method             Statistic    p-value
  ---------------------------- ------------ ---------
           Lilliefors             0.2223    2.243e-92
      (Kolmogorov-Smirnov)                  
         normality test                     

   Anderson-Darling normality     42.04     3.31e-90
              test                          

  Shapiro-Wilk normality test     0.7985    6.366e-28
  ---------------------------------------------------

So, the conclusions we can draw with the help of test statistics:

-   based on *Lilliefors test*, distribution of *Internet usage for
    educational purposes (hours per day)* is not normal

-   *Anderson-Darling test* confirms violation of normality assumption

-   according to *Shapiro-Wilk test*, the distribution of *Internet
    usage for educational purposes (hours per day)* is not normal

As you can see, the applied tests confirm departures from normality.

### Normality assumption check (*Age*)

The [*Shapiro-Wilk
test*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapiro%E2%80%93Wilk_test), the
[*Lilliefors test*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilliefors_test) and
the [*Anderson-Darling
test*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_Darling_test) help us to
decide if the above-mentioned assumption can be accepted of the
*Internet usage for educational purposes (hours per day)*.

  ---------------------------------------------------
             Method             Statistic    p-value

              test                          

  Shapiro-Wilk normality test     0.8216    9.445e-27
  ---------------------------------------------------

So, the conclusions we can draw with the help of test statistics:

-   based on *Lilliefors test*, distribution of *Age* is not normal

-   *Anderson-Darling test* confirms violation of normality assumption

-   according to *Shapiro-Wilk test*, the distribution of *Age* is not
    normal

As you can see, the applied tests confirm departures from normality.

*In this case it is advisable to run a more robust test, then the
F-test.*

### Introduction

F test compares the means of two continuous variables. In other words it
shows if their means were statistically different. We should be careful,
while using the F test, because of the strict normality assumption,
where strict means approximately normal ditribution is not enough to
satisfy that.

### The F-test

Here is the the result of the *F test* to compare the means of *Internet
usage for educational purposes (hours per day)* and *Age*.

  ------------------------------------------------
          Method          Statistic     p-value

  F test to compare two    0.08618     3.772e-180
        variances                     
  ------------------------------------------------

We can see from the table (in the p-value coloumn) that there is a
significant difference between the means of *Internet usage for
educational purposes (hours per day)* and *Age*.
