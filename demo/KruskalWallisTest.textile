In this template Rapporter will present you Kruskal Wallis test.

h3(#introduction). Introduction

"Kruskal-Wallis test":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal-Wallis is a non-parametric statistical test that assesses hypothesis of equality of two independent sample's/variabels' variances. Most of the time it's being used beacuse the normality assumptions didn't meet for the samples/variables, but we need the assumption of the equal variances, so it can be an alternative of the Two-sample t-test. Significant result means difference between the samples/variables.

As you can see in the table the test's degrees of freedom is _1_, the joint test-statistic is _1010_, so the p-value of the Kruskal-Wallis test is _1.056e-221_. Thus we can reject the assumption of the equal variances.
