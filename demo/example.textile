Hello, world!

I have just specified a _Variable_ in this template named to *leisure*. The label of this variable is &quot;Internet usage in leisure time (hours per day)&quot;.

And wow, the mean of _leisure_ is _3.199_!

By checking out the "sources of this template":https://github.com/aL3xa/rapport/blob/master/inst/templates/example.tpl, you could see that we used all @BRCATCODE@s above from @brew@ syntax. @BRCODE@ tags are useful when you want to loop through something or optionally add or remove a part of the template. A really easy example of this: if @desc@ input equals to @TRUE@, then the resulting report would have that chunk, if set to @FALSE@, it would be left our.
