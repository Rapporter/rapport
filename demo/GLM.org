** Description

In this template Rapporter will present you GLM.

*** Introduction

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model][Generalized
Linear Model (GLM)]] is a generalization of the ordinary
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression][Linear Regression]].
While using GLM we don't need the assumption of normality for response
variables. There are two basic ideas of the model: It allows the linear
model to be related to the response variable via a link function and the
magnitude of the variance of each measurement to be a function of its
predicted value. An extinsion to the GLM is the
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_generalized_linear_model][Hierarchical
generalized linear model]].

* Overview

Multivariate-General Linear Model was carried out, with /Internet usage
in leisure time (hours per day)/ and /Internet usage for educational
purposes (hours per day)/ as independent variables, and /Age/ as a
dependent variable. The
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction][interaction]] between the
independent variables was taken into account.

| *(Intercept)*   | 3.198      | 0.02122      | 150.7     | 0          |

/edu/

From the table one can see that

-  (Intercept) has significant effect on the dependent variable, the
   p-value of that is 0
-  leisure has significant effect on the dependent variable, the p-value
   of that is 0.001
-  leisure:edu has significant effect on the dependent variable, the
   p-value of that is 0.013
