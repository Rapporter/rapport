** Description

Test of homogeneity of a given factor variable split by another factor.

*** Variable description

Analysing "gender" ("Gender") with /673/ valid values whether frequency
counts are distributed equally across different categories of "dwell"
("Dwelling").

"dwell" has /3/ categories:

-  city
-  small town
-  village

| *city*         | 338    | 234      | 27        | 599   |

*** Chi-squared test

Our [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_hypothesis][null hypothetis]]
says that the proportion of /gender/ is indentical in each categories of
/dwell/.

| Test statistic   | df   | P value       |
|------------------+------+---------------|
| 16.18            | 6    | /0.01282/ *   |
#+CAPTION: Pearson's Chi-squared test: =table=

The chi-squared test returned the value of /16.18/ with a degree of
freedom being /6/. Based on the returned
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value][p value]] (/0.01282/) we could
state that the null hypothesis is rejected.
