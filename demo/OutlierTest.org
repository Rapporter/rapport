** Description

This template will check if provided variable has any outliers.

*** Introduction

An outlying observation, or outlier, is one that appears to deviate
markedly from other members of the sample in which it occurs. There are
several ways to detect the outliers of our data. However, we cannot say
one of them is the perfect method for that, thus it could be useful to
take different methods into consideration. We present here four of them,
one by a chart (a Box Plot based on IQR) and three by statistical
descriptions (Lund Test, Grubb's test, Dixon's test).

*** Charts

Among the graphical displays the Box plots are quite widespread, because
of their several advantages. For example, one can easily get
approximately punctual first impression from the data and one can
visually see the positions of the (possible) outliers, with the help of
them.

The Box Plot we used here is based on IQR (Interquartile Range), which
is the difference between the higher and the lower quartiles. On the
chart the blue box shows the "middle-half" of the data, the so-called
whiskers shows the border where from the possible values can be called
outliers. The lower whisker is placed 1.5 times below the first
quartile, similarly the higher whisker 1.5 times above the third
quartile.

*** Lund test

It seems that /4/ extreme values can be found in "Internet usage for
educational purposes (hours per day)". These are: /10/, /0.5/, /1.5/ and
/0.5/.

**** Explanation

The above test for outliers was based on /lm(edu ~ 1)/:

|                 | Estimate   | Std. Error   | t value   | Pr(>|t|)     |
|-----------------+------------+--------------+-----------+--------------|
| *(Intercept)*   | 2.048      | 0.07797      | 26.27     | 7.939e-105   |

Grubbs test for one outlier shows that highest value 12 is an outlier
(p=/0.0001964/).

chi-squared test for outlier shows that highest value 12 is an outlier
(p=/7.441e-07/).
