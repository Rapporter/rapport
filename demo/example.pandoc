## Description



This template demonstrates the basic features of rapport. We all hope you will like it!







### Début





Hello, world!

I have just specified a *Variable* in this template named to **leisure**. The label of this variable is "Internet usage in leisure time (hours per day)".

And wow, the mean of *leisure* is _3.199_!









By checking out the [sources of this template](https://github.com/aL3xa/rapport/blob/master/inst/templates/example.tpl), you could see that we used all `BRCATCODE`s above from `brew` syntax. `BRCODE` tags are useful when you want to loop through something or optionally add or remove a part of the template. A really easy example of this: if `desc` input equals to `TRUE`, then the resulting report would have that chunk, if set to `FALSE`, it would be left our.







#### Descriptive statistics
